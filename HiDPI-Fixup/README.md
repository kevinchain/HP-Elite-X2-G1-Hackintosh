# HiDPI Script

So the above script is for convience if macOS ever kicks the custom HiDPI setting and you need to reapply(or apply for the first time). Main thing to change in this script:

* Assumes the pathing to this repo is `~/Documents/Github/HP-Elite-X2-G1-Hackintosh`, change this to the correct name

This script injects the following resolutions:

* 1280 x 854
* 1280 x 854 (HiDPI)

To add more custom resoltuions, see Rehabman's post: [Adding/Using HiDPI custom resolutions](http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/adding-using-hidpi-custom-resolutions.133254/)

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues seeing the new HiDPI entry in macOS, you can try running [RDM](https://github.com/usr-sse2/RDM/releases)
